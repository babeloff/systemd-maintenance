= Bluefin Systemd Maintenance Services

A set of `systemctrl --system` and `systemctrl --user`` services for doing basic maintenance tasks.
There are also some Justfile to run them.
These are targeting project bluefin who should feel free to incorporate whichever ones they like.

== Related Work

I am also working on a couple of other projects related 
to making systemd work better for me that may be somewhat relevant. 
Hopefully, I will be able to get them into a functional state.
